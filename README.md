This was a project for Disqus Hack Week Winter '17/'18. @dan-disqus and I built a graph of Disqus websites, connected by those who had mutual commenters. We then fed the graph into igraph, fancied up the SVG a bit, and exported it to Maptiler, which generated the map you see here.

All the data used to construct this graph is accessible via Disqus' open APIs.
